# üìÉOpen API Specification For Hanami

OasHanami is a tool for generating **automatic interactive documentation for your Hanami APIs**. It generates an **OAS 3.1** document and displays it using **[RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com)**.

Built for the modern [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org) framework, OasHanami leverages Hanami's lightweight and modular design, making it ideal for building scalable Ruby applications. It relies on the [OasCore](https://github.com/a-chacon/oas_core) gem for seamless OpenAPI integration.
